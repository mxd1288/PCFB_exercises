# Exercise 3

# Collaborating in github
# now you known you to use version control with git
# This is especially useful when you are collaborating on code

# Get into a group with 2-3 people
# Have one person make a new repository called "recipes"
# The repository should include a file with a recipe name (e.g. soup)

# Have your group members clone the repository 
# Each person should add one ingredient to the recipe

# What happens if you aren't the first person to commit a change?
# How can you get the most up to date version of the recipe?
# How can you resolve discrepancies?

# Useful commands:
git pull
git diff
